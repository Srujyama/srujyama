### 🧠 About Me

I'm a researcher working at the intersection of biological systems, machine learning, and quantitative analysis. Whether I’m decoding fruit fly behavior in a lab, modeling ecological decisions with deep learning, or designing bioinformatics pipelines at scale — my work is driven by one question:

> _"How do we build smarter systems that understand the world?"_

- 🔬 **Research** at CHAI, CHOP, Princeton, Cornell, and UD
- 📈 **Exploring** quantitative trading, data structures for finance, and model-driven markets
- ✍️ **Writing** code that makes messy data make sense
